[Boundaries of language design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K8znjWN_Ig&t=10s)

Ginger Bill suggestions for building a language:
- Learn tokenization, parsing (recursive decending)
- Lean how to do basic type checking (maybe type inference?)
- Go straight to machine code from a simple language (Pascal, C?)
- Then learn about IR
- Consider different style langages: Pascal, C, Python, Lisp
- The core of a compiler (ignoring optimization) is the "semantic checking stage"

- Start with something similar: wasm first
